# Jedox Macro: Dynamic PALO.FILTER Generator

This repository provides a Jedox PHP macro to dynamically generate regular expressions (PerlExp) for the `PALO.FILTER` function. This is especially useful for cubes with many dimensions where users want to filter base elements beneath a consolidated element across multiple dimensions.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

Jedox cubes can contain high-dimensional structures with nested consolidations. This macro automates the extraction of base-level elements from any selected consolidated element and builds a dynamic filter expression (`~|element1|element2|...`) for use in PALO formulas, improving performance and flexibility in report-building.

---

## 📋 Features

- Recursively extracts all **base-level elements** under any selected consolidated element.
- Returns:
  - PerlExp strings for `PALO.FILTER`-compatible formulas
  - An array representation of all base elements
  - Execution time to help monitor performance
- Filters across 7 dimensions:
  - Company
  - DDC (Div-Dept-Cost Center)
  - Classification
  - Line of Business (LOB)
  - Sub Line of Business
  - Business Type
  - Location

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Start From Consolidated Element**  
   The macro checks if a selected element is consolidated.

2. **Traverse Down**  
   It recursively calls Jedox functions `PALO_ELEMENT_LIST_CHILDREN` and `PALO_ETYPE` to get all descendant base elements.

3. **Generate PerlExp**  
   Uses the format `~|Base1|Base2|...` for filtering in Jedox reports.

4. **Output Results**  
   Writes both array and string outputs to the "Backend" sheet in specified cells.

## 🧩 File Structure

- `getbaseelements()`  
  Core recursive function to traverse the dimension tree.

- `getchildren()` / `getconsolidated()`  
  Wrapper helpers to call Jedox functions and format outputs.

- `buildperlexp()`  
  Main driver function that:
  - Reads input from the spreadsheet
  - Triggers the base element retrieval
  - Builds PerlExp filters
  - Writes back results to the spreadsheet

## 📌 Prerequisites

- Jedox Integrator enabled
- PHP macro support in Jedox
- Sheet named **`Backend`** with expected structure:
  - Server/database defined at `C2`
  - Dimensions listed from `B9:B15`
  - Corresponding selected elements in `C9:C15`
  - Optional filter checkbox in `F19`

## 📤 Output Cells

| Output Type         | Range     |
|---------------------|-----------|
| PerlExp Filters     | `F9:F15`  |
| Base Element Arrays | `E9:E15`  |
| Execution Time      | `F18`     |

## ✅ Example Output

| Dimension | Consolidated Element | Base Elements                | PerlExp Filter              |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Company   | `TDSC`               | `{TDSC1, TDSC2}`             | `~|TDSC1|TDSC2`             |
| DDC       | `901-02-21`          | `{901-02-21-01, -02, -03}`   | `~|901-02-21-01|...`        |

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

- You can expand this to support additional dimensions by adding rows in the backend sheet and replicating the logic.
- Adjust `$max_exec_time` in `getbaseelements()` if you expect large dimension trees.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- The macro includes a timer to prevent infinite loops in deeply nested hierarchies.
- Performance depends on the number of elements under a consolidation.
